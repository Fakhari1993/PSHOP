# PSHOP

Project Overview

**PSHOP** is a desktop-based **Store Management System** built with **C# and .NET Windows Forms**.  
It provides an integrated platform for managing day-to-day store operations such as **sales, purchases, inventory tracking, and basic accounting**.  

The project demonstrates practical implementation of data handling, form design, dataset usage, and modular business logic â€” making it a strong portfolio example for desktop software development.
The system is also designed to integrate with a broader ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) platform, allowing seamless data exchange between the store management module and other enterprise components such as accounting, HR, and logistics.

- Resources and icons are managed within the application for consistent UI design.

| Module | Description |
| **BASE** | Core configuration, product info, and shared data. |
| **SALE** | Handles customer sales, invoicing, and related transactions. |
| **ACNT** | Accounting and financial tracking. |
| **WHRS** | Warehouse / inventory control. |
| **MAIN** | Central coordination and navigation hub. |
